Count the number of ways to partition a set of $n$ labelled objects into $k$ nonempty labelled subsets.

$$f(n, k) = \sum_{i=0}^{k}(-1)^i\binom{k}{i}(k-i)^n$$

Stirling Number 2nd: Partitions of an $n$ element set into $k$ not-empty set. 
Or count the number of ways to partition a set of $n$ labelled objects into $k$ nonempty unlabelled subsets.

$$S_{2nd}(n, k) = \begin{Bmatrix} n \\ k \end{Bmatrix} = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{i=0}^{k}(-1)^i\binom{k}{i}(k-i)^n$$

Euler's formula: $f = e - v + 2$

Euler's formula to $n$ Lines or Segment if there is no three lines/segments that contains the same point: $R = intersects + component - n$

Number of regions in a planar graph: $R = E - V + C + 1$ where C is the number of connected components

Given $a$ and $b$ co-prime, $n = a \cdot x + b \cdot y$ where $x \ge 0$ and $y \ge 0$. 
You are required to find the least value of n, such that all currency values greater than or equal to $n$ can be made using any number of coins of denomination $a$ and $b$: $n = (a-1)*(b-1)$

generalization of the above problem, $n$ is multiple of $gcd(a, b)$: $n = lcm(a, b) - a - b + gcd(a, b)$
