Count the number of ways to partition a set of $n$ labelled objects into $k$ nonempty labelled subsets.

$$f(n, k) = \sum_{i=0}^{k}(-1)^i\binom{k}{i}(k-i)^n$$

Stirling Number 2nd: Partitions of an $n$ element set into $k$ not-empty set. Or count the number of ways to partition a set of $n$ labelled objects into $k$ nonempty unlabelled subsets.

$$S_{2nd}(n, k) = \begin{Bmatrix} n \\ k \end{Bmatrix} = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{i=0}^{k}(-1)^i\binom{k}{i}(k-i)^n$$

Euler's formula: $f = e - v + 2$

Number of regions in a planar graph: $R = E - V + C + 1$ where C is the number of connected components
